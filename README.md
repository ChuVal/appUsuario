# Posifi_app


This project is being developed to serve as platform for internal positioning at the Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales(MNAV). 

Together with the MNAV, three engineering students from Facultad de Ingenieria UdelaR have made this app as a project for their final thesis. The application will let visitors know where they are in any moment inside the museum and listen to pre-recorded audio of the exhibitions on each floor of the museum. The app also lets users know about any upcoming programs and general information regarding the museum.
